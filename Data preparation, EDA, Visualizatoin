Part 1: Tabular Dataset

Dataset

Choose a diverse tabular dataset such as NYC Taxi Fare or Airbnb Listings. Ensure the dataset contains multiple data types (e.g., numerical, categorical, text).

Steps:

EDA and Visualization

Conduct a detailed exploratory data analysis.

Use manual and automated tools (e.g., Pandas Profiling, Sweetviz).

Include summary statistics, data distributions, correlation heatmaps, and visualizations for key trends.

Data Cleaning

Handle missing values via imputation or removal.

Detect and eliminate anomalies using clustering techniques.

Normalize and encode features as required (e.g., label encoding or one-hot encoding for categorical features).

Feature Processing

Conduct feature selection using techniques like variance thresholding, feature importance metrics, or dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA).

Generate new features if applicable.

Model Building

Build various ML models, including ensemble models, using AutoVIML or similar AutoML tools.

Evaluate models on appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, or MAPE).

Artifacts

Save the executed Colab notebook.

Save processed datasets and feature sets.

Part 2: Time-Series Dataset

Dataset

Select a time-series dataset such as daily temperatures, stock prices, or energy consumption. Ensure the dataset reflects temporal patterns.

Steps:

EDA and Visualization

Visualize trends, seasonality, and anomalies using line plots, seasonal decomposition, and autocorrelation plots.

Analyze temporal features (e.g., day-of-week trends, monthly averages).

Data Cleaning

Handle missing timestamps via interpolation or removal.

Smooth noisy data using rolling averages or filters.

Detect and remove anomalies using clustering techniques or statistical thresholds.

Feature Engineering

Create lag features, rolling statistics, and time-based features (e.g., hour, day of week, month).

Normalize and scale features as necessary.

Model Building

Build time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM).

Use AutoML tools to evaluate multiple models and select the best-performing one.

Artifacts

Save the executed Colab notebook.

Save processed datasets and feature sets.
